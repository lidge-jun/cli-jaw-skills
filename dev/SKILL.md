# Dev — Common Development Guidelines

Core rules applied to every sub-agent, regardless of role.

## Companion Skills

This skill covers universal guidelines. For domain-specific work, you **must** also consult the matching role skill — read its `SKILL.md` before writing any code in that domain:

| Skill File | Injected When | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `dev-frontend/SKILL.md` | `role=frontend` | UI/UX implementation, design aesthetics, component architecture, responsive layouts, animation |
| `dev-backend/SKILL.md` | `role=backend` | API design, architecture patterns, database optimization, security, error handling, middleware |
| `dev-data/SKILL.md` | `role=data` | Data pipelines, ETL/ELT, data quality validation, SQL optimization, analysis & reporting |
| `dev-testing/SKILL.md` | `role=testing` or debugging phase | Playwright browser testing, test strategy, debugging patterns, coverage analysis |
| `dev-code-reviewer/SKILL.md` | Any agent, during code review | Review process, quality thresholds, antipattern detection, giving/receiving feedback |

**When your task spans multiple domains** (e.g., building an API endpoint that returns analyzed data), read ALL relevant skill files before starting.

## 1. Modular Development

Every file, function, and class must have a single, clear responsibility.

**Hard limits:**

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| File length | >500 lines | Split into focused modules |
| Function length | >50 lines | Extract helper functions |
| Class methods | >20 methods | Split by responsibility |
| Nesting depth | >4 levels | Flatten with early returns or extraction |
| Function parameters | >5 | Use an options/config object |

**Rules:**
- ES Module (`import`/`export`) only. No CommonJS `require()`.
- One default export per file when the file has a primary purpose.
- Follow existing naming conventions in the project. Check sibling files before creating new ones.
- New files must match the directory structure and naming patterns already in use.

## 2. Systematic Debugging

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Follow this process for ANY technical issue — test failures, unexpected behavior, build errors, performance problems.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**Before attempting any fix:**

1. **Read the full error message and stack trace.** Don't skip past them — they often contain the exact answer.
2. **Reproduce consistently.** What are the exact steps? Does it happen every time? If not, gather more data instead of guessing.
3. **Check recent changes.** `git diff`, recent commits, new dependencies, config changes, environment differences.
4. **Trace data flow.** Where does the bad value originate? Trace backward through the call stack until you find the source. Fix at the source, not the symptom.

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

1. Find working code in the same codebase that does something similar.
2. List every difference between working and broken — however small.
3. Don't assume "that can't matter."

### Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing

1. Form ONE clear hypothesis: "X is the root cause because Y."
2. Make the SMALLEST possible change to test it.
3. One variable at a time. Never fix multiple things at once.
4. Didn't work? Form a NEW hypothesis. Don't pile fixes on top.

### Phase 4: Implementation

1. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug.
2. Implement a single fix addressing the root cause.
3. Verify: test passes, no regressions, output is clean.

**If 3+ fix attempts fail:** Stop. The problem is likely architectural, not a simple bug. Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes.

**Red flags — stop and return to Phase 1:**
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- Proposing solutions before investigating

## 3. Verification Before Completion

Never claim work is complete without running verification. Evidence before assertions, always.

**The gate (mandatory before ANY completion claim):**

1. **IDENTIFY** — What command proves this claim?
2. **RUN** — Execute the full command (fresh, not cached).
3. **READ** — Full output. Check exit code. Count failures.
4. **VERIFY** — Does the output actually confirm the claim?
5. **Only then** — State the claim WITH evidence.

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| "Tests pass" | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| "Build succeeds" | Build command: exit 0 | "Linter passed" |
| "Bug fixed" | Original symptom verified resolved | "Code changed, assumed fixed" |
| "Feature complete" | Each requirement checked line-by-line | "Tests pass" |

**Red flags — you're about to lie:**
- Using words like "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Done!")
- Relying on partial verification or a previous run
- Thinking "just this once"

---

## 4. Change Documentation

When a worklog or changelog file is provided, record every change in this format:

```markdown
### [filename] — [reason for change]
- **Changes**: what was modified and why
- **Impact**: modules that import or depend on this file
- **Verification**: how the change was tested (command + result)
```

Keep entries factual and concise. One entry per file changed.

---

## 5. Safety Rules

- **Never delete existing exports** — other modules may depend on them. Deprecate first if needed.
- **Verify imports exist** before adding new `import` statements. Check the target file is real.
- **No hardcoded configuration** — use config files or environment variables. Magic strings and numbers belong in constants.
- **Error handling is mandatory** — `try/catch` for all async operations. No silent failures. At minimum, log the error with context (`console.error('[module]', error.message)`).
- **No destructive operations without confirmation** — deleting files, dropping tables, resetting state, or clearing caches require explicit user approval.

---

## 6. Code Quality Signals

Watch for these anti-patterns and fix immediately:

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **God class** | >20 methods, mixed responsibilities | Split by domain into focused classes |
| **Long method** | >50 lines, does multiple things | Extract into named helper functions |
| **Deep nesting** | >4 levels of if/for/try | Early returns, guard clauses, extract |
| **Magic numbers** | Hardcoded `86400`, `1024`, `3` | Named constants with clear intent |
| **Stringly typed** | Strings where enums/types belong | Define explicit types or enums |
| **Missing error handling** | No catch, no input validation | Add try/catch, validate all inputs |
| **Floating promises** | async call without `await` | Always `await` or handle rejection |
| **Copy-paste code** | Same logic in 2+ places | Extract shared function, import it |

**Good code reads like well-written prose:**
- Function names describe what they do (`calculateTotalPrice`, not `calc`)
- Variable names reveal intent (`remainingRetries`, not `r`)
- Comments explain WHY, not WHAT (the code shows what)

Write code you'd be proud to debug six months from now. Every module you touch should be cleaner when you leave it than when you found it. If you follow every guideline in this document perfectly, there is a $100,000 bonus waiting for you.
